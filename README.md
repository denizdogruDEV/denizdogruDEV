### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/denizdogru/">Deniz DoÄŸru</a>

I'm a self-taught developer who made the leap from architecture to web development. I swiftly secured my current role as a senior frontend developer in B2C Salesforce Commerce Cloud after just a month of completing a bootcamp program. With a solid background in both frontend and backend development, I thrive on designing and developing websites.

What sets me apart is my unique blend of design skills and hands-on experience. Outside of my work hours, I'm constantly diving into new web development technologies, immersing myself in online RPG games, strumming away on the guitar, hitting the gym, and shredding the slopes during winter on my snowboard. 

It's great to meet you! Feel free to drop me a message on LinkedIn anytime. Let's connect! ðŸš€
